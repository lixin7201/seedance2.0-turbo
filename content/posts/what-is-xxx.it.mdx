Seedance 2.0 is a next-generation AI video generation model that represents a major leap in AI-powered content creation. Built on a novel dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture, it generates cinematic videos with native audio, multi-shot narratives, and physics-based motion — all from text prompts, images, video clips, and audio references.

Our platform provides independent access to Seedance 2.0's video generation capabilities through a user-friendly interface. We are not affiliated with ByteDance — we offer this technology as an independent service to make advanced AI video creation accessible to everyone.

## Core Technology — Dual-Branch Diffusion Transformer

At the heart of Seedance 2.0 lies the **dual-branch diffusion transformer** — an architecture that processes video and audio generation in parallel through two specialized branches:

- **Visual Branch**: Handles frame generation, motion planning, and scene composition
- **Audio Branch**: Generates dialogue, sound effects, and music synchronized with the visual output

This parallel generation means audio and video are created together from the same source, achieving **frame-level lip-sync accuracy** (within 1 frame) — unlike other AI video tools that add audio as a post-process.

### Spatial-Temporal Causal Modeling (STCM)

Seedance 2.0 introduces Spatial-Temporal Causal Modeling (STCM), which enhances the model's understanding of 3D space and temporal dynamics. This means:

- **Gravity and inertia** behave realistically — objects fall, bounce, and slide naturally
- **Object interactions** are physically plausible — cloth flows, liquids splash, and debris scatters
- **Dynamic memory** maintains consistency across frames — no sudden jumps or physics violations

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Input (12 References)

Seedance 2.0 supports up to 12 simultaneous reference inputs:
- **Up to 9 images** — for character, scene, and style reference
- **Up to 3 video clips** (15 seconds total) — for camera and motion reference
- **Up to 3 audio files** (15 seconds total) — for rhythm and soundtrack reference
- **Text prompt** — for scene description and directing

### 2. Native Audio-Visual Sync

The dual-branch architecture generates sound and vision simultaneously:
- Lip-sync accuracy within 1 frame
- Dialogue, sound effects, and ambient audio generated natively
- No "dubbed" or post-processed feel

### 3. Multi-Shot Storytelling

Generate connected multi-scene narratives with:
- Consistent character identity across wide shots, medium shots, and close-ups
- Uniform lighting and atmosphere throughout scenes
- Automatic shot planning and transitions

### 4. Auto Camera & Directing

Seedance 2.0 acts as an AI director:
- Automatic shot sequence planning
- Intelligent camera angle selection
- Dynamic transitions based on scene content

### 5. First & Last Frame Control

Upload start and end frame images for:
- Precise transition control
- Smooth motion interpolation
- Perfect loop creation

### 6. Physics-Aware Generation

Powered by STCM:
- Realistic gravity, inertia, and friction
- Cloth dynamics, fluid simulation, and particle effects
- Natural light behavior and material interactions
